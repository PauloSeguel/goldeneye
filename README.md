Application service quality assurance based on networking infrastructure


## Business/Technical Challenge

Currently, our customer don't have enough visiblity of their applications 
performance in their networks. This impacts on user experience.
In a real time application, such as video, there's no fast and 
automatic manner to identify where and when the issues happen.

The related troubleshooting generates expensive and time consuming efforts
for operations teams. For a customer this means lower end user satisfaction, 
higher costs, higher CHURN among others.

## Proposed Solution

Our solution monitor, troubleshoot and takes action to mitigate 
and solve issues that impact end users.
It leverages the full automation closed-loop and the capablities 
to run 3rd party applications on network infrastructure. 

The solution allows the visibility on traffic at application level
in order to have faster and smarter decisions based on network and 
application level criteria.

In this phase we'll focus on video as the application, and the use
cases of automatic traffic re-route and creation/destruction of virtual 
routers for traffic/suscription growth behavior lading to improved 
end user experience and lower costs.
